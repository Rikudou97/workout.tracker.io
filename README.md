 You can see the project hosted here: https://rikudou97.github.io/workout.tracker.io/

This project is created during the `The Complete JavaScript Course 2023: From Zero to Expert!', from Udemy.

This is a workout tracker app, just running and cycling for now, but in the future it will be more complex. It was created using OOP.
You can interact with a map via geolocation API and pin a workout on it. 
The workouts are locally stored.
If you click on every single one of the workouts listed on the left of the app, the map will focus on the corresponding pin.
